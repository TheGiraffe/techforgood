## Project Description: 
React web application for connecting local Hawai’i organizations (i.e. nonprofits) who need technical projects done (i.e. websites, apps, volunteer databases) with students and upskillers (which we’ve called users) who are learning these skills and need more portfolio projects and/or volunteer hours. Can be a platform to help facilitate giveback projects. Eventually, it would be wonderful to have the platform help facilitate team-building as well, and be able to bring in users who are photographers, videographers, DJs, designers, etc to round out the teams and help create high-quality final products.

**Frontend**: React → Focusing on frontend first.

**Backend**: Node + Firebase → Slides says that backend support is optional, but it would be important for the functionality for our project. We will focus on this after our initial frontend prototyping.
